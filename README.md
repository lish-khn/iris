# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification using Random Forest

This project applies a **Random Forest Classifier** to classify iris flowers into three species â€” *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* â€” based on petal and sepal dimensions. It's a classic machine learning problem solved using Scikit-learn.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with the following features:

- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

Each sample is labeled as one of the following species:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Perform train-test split
3. Train a **Random Forest Classifier**
4. Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
5. Visualize feature importance and decision boundaries

## ðŸ“¦ Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

The Random Forest model typically achieves over **95% accuracy** on the test data, thanks to its ensemble nature and robustness to overfitting.
